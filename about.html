                    <p>"charles & jade", a name inspired by the famous fashion brand charles & keith, is a website created by Charles Jade O. Argawanon (me!) for his final project in CIS1102. 
                        This website showcases the portfolios compiled throughout the semester. 
                        Each portfolio features unique topics that enhance students' understanding of computers, in line with the course title, 'Introduction to Computing.' 
                        The topics range from the inner workings of a computer to its physical application in the real world. 
                        Whether itâ€™s hardware or software, this website aims to share the knowledge that I have thoroughly compiled.
                    </p>
                    <p>This website is designed to be as simple as possible, focusing solely on the content of the portfolios. 
                        I aimed to avoid flashy decorations and unnecessary elements. 
                        With the site primarily using black and white, it ensures that users won't be distracted by potential visual clutter. 
                        Although this is my first project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have strived to keep the design simple and elegant, and I hope
                        that it reflects on how you (the users!) think about it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Other than that there is not much about the site. The portfolio themselves were done a little bit hastily during the time of production so please
                        bare in mind that they are not that well made. Additionally a lot of my formatting within the portfolios themselves are inconsistent, but that shouldn't
                        matter much as the site's primary purpose is to display the portfolio's in a concise and organized way. Anyhoos, I hope you enjoy your time here,
                        I apologize if the about section is a little bit informal...

                        <p> Hi! My name is Charles Jade O. Argawanon, and I created this site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                            I am an aspiring Computer Science student, eager to contribute to the industry in one way or another. 
                            Although I am still figuring out which specific profession to pursue, I enjoy exploring the various possibilities that technology offers, such as webpage creation! 
                            This is my very first site, and I hope you enjoy your visit.
