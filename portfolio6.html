                        The motherboard is the heart of the computer, as it connects all the different components of the system (Tomljanovic & Kurelovic, 2013). 
                        It is important for the functionality as it is the core component that facilitates communication between the processor, memory, storage, and peripheral devices. 
                        With the rapid development of technology, it is no surprise that hardware components, especially motherboards, have evolved significantly over the years. 
                        What was once bulky with limited functions has now are now smaller, more efficient, and multifunctional. 
                        This comparative study will examine the evolution of different motherboard form factors throughout the years, exploring how these changes were driven by technological advancements and the shifting needs of users. 
                        By understanding the reasons behind the creation of each form factor, we can gain deeper insight as to how these motherboards have shaped modern computing as a whole.
